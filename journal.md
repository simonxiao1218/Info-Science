#This is my journal for Info Sci

1. What did we do? We were introduced to the basics of computational thinking and info science. We simulated a computers actions through making a sandwich. 
1. What did you learn? I learnt about the basics of computational thinking, which comes in 4 steps. I also learnt about the being precise and specific when creating computer algorithms.Computers do not have the common sense that we carry. So actions that seems automatic and obvious for us has to be stated explicitly for the computer.
1. What questions do you have? I am curious about how we can input instructions to a real computer.
