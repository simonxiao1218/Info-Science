1. What did we do? We were introduced to the basics of computational thinking and info science. We simulated a computers actions through making a sandwich. 
1. What did you learn? I learnt about the basics of computational thinking, which comes in 4 steps. I also learnt about the being precise and specific when creating computer algorithms.Computers do not have the common sense that we carry. So actions that seems automatic and obvious for us has to be stated explicitly for the computer.
1. What questions do you have? I am curious about how we can input instructions to a real computer.

1. What did we do? We experimented with different commands in Processing to create different shapes. We experimented with colour, size, frequency and shape.
1. What did you learn? I learnt the basics of programming in Processing. i was able to create simple shapes. I learnt about background colours, fill colours, size and shapes.
1. What questions do you have? For homework, i have to create a dice image. I am still struggling a bit but I will research into the parts that I am unsure about.

1. What did we do? We made our dice image into a dice simulator that was able to give us a random number of dots between 1 and 6 whenever we "rolled" (clicked) it. We then made certain numbers more or less likely to be shown, we challenged other groups to guess which side had the bias.
1. What did you learn? I learnt how to use the random feature, as well as applying bias and increasing or decreasing the probability of a certain outcome.
1. 1. What questions do you have? While I have a basic idea of how to apply "bias," i am still not confident this the technique
